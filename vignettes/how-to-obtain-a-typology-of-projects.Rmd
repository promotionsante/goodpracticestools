## How to explore the variability of the projects

The data was prepared using the `prepare_data()` function. See the article [How to prepare data for statistical analysis](https://promotionsante.github.io/goodpracticestools/articles/how-to-prepare-data-for-statistical-analysis.html) for more details.

```{r}
data("data_fr")
```

The data are analyzed using **Multiple Correspondence Analysis** (MCA), a statistical method that helps explore and visualize relationships between several categorical variables. 

In this analysis, the active variables are as follows: 

- the A/B/C/D columns,
- the level column, 
- the theme columns, 
- the target groups columns,  
- and the settings columns. 

MCA allows for the identification of underlying structures and associations between these variables, providing a clear view of the links and patterns present in the data. 

Following the MCA, a **Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components** (HCPC) is performed to further group similar observations and enhance the interpretation of the results.

The `get_clusters()` function realizes the analysis:

```{r}
res_analysis <- get_clusters(
  data = data_fr
)
```
